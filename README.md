### Hello, and welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Pedro Curto. I'm a student from Lisbon, Portugal, with great passion for problem solving and technology.

- 🎓 Currently in the 1st year of my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.
- 👨‍💻 Very keen on problem solving and algorithmic exercises -- I like solving [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/pedro_curto/) occasionally
- 🏀🎷 Former federate basketball player and former saxophonist at SFUA (local philharmonic)
  
In the pinned repositories, I have:
- **ParkZ**, an award winning project I developed with a great team to **win our category** at Tecstorm
- **CMS**, a project that I made for a recruitment that uses **Spring, Vue and TS**
- **MEIC-projects and LEIC-projects**, two indexes, for the projects I made during my BsC and MsC
